## 🎯 Why Bare Workflow?

- **🔧 Full Native Control**: Direct access to Xcode and Android Studio configurations
- **📱 Real-World Skills**: Industry-standard practices used by professional teams
- **🌟 Expo DX Benefits**: Keep the great developer experience without vendor lock-in
- **🚀 Career Ready**: Build skills that translate directly to professional mobile development

## 🎓 Program Overview

### Core Philosophy
- **Pragmatic Learning**: Theory immediately applied to practice
- **Professional Workflow**: Mirror modern agile software teams
- **Continuous Growth**: Cultivate lifelong learning mindset

### Learning Outcomes
By completion, participants will be able to:
- ✅ Architect and build cross-platform mobile applications
- ✅ Manage native project configurations in Xcode & Android Studio
- ✅ Implement secure authentication systems
- ✅ Handle complex data and state management
- ✅ Collaborate effectively using agile methodologies
- ✅ Write and test professional-grade code
- ✅ Deploy applications to App Store and Google Play

## 📚 What Makes This Different?

Unlike other React Native tutorials that rely heavily on Expo's managed workflow, this program:

- **Starts with `react-native init`** - No managed Expo dependencies
- **Teaches native configuration** - Manual setup of permissions, certificates, and native modules
- **Uses community libraries** - react-native-vision-camera, react-native-maps, etc.
- **Covers real deployment** - Manual build, signing, and store submission
- **Focuses on collaboration** - Git workflows, code reviews, agile practices

## 🎯 Target Projects

The program includes several project archetypes that teach different aspects:

- **📱 Personal Profile App** (Week 1)
- **✅ Full-Stack To-Do App** (Week 2)  
- **✈️ Airline Booking App** (Capstone - Weeks 3-10)

Additional project templates:
- 🎪 Event Discovery & Ticketing
- 🍳 Recipe & Meal Planning
- 📚 Language Learning Flashcards
- 🛒 E-commerce Marketplace
- 🏃 Fitness & Workout Tracker
- 📍 Local Guide & Review App
- 💺 Seat Booking System
